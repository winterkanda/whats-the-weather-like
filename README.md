## Hey, What's the Weather Like Today?
&nbsp;  

## Description 

This application is a weather dashboard which forecasts the current weather in the city you search, and a five day forecast thereafter using an OpenWeather One Call API, which retrieves the weather data for cities. The weather dashboard is built with a third-party API, an updated HTML and CSS which allows the user to access the data they need and work with a functional website.
